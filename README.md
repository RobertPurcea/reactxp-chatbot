## Hello, some thoughts on the project

  1. API key usage

    Normally, I would hide the API key but you said 'no backend'.
    Thus, I must be able to somehow hide the key on the client side.
    That's not possible as any request you send on the client is on the dev. tools network tab, along with information about it, including the URL and thus, your API key.

    Possible solution: Do the request in the backend, and create an endpoint for it.

  2. As you said, I could have created the AI myself but I felt like using cleverbot was a better way

  3. I've used the exact components you asked for. I haven't thought about making other components since your request was specific
